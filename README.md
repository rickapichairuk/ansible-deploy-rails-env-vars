# ansible-deploy-rails-env-vars

A role to deploy new env vars for configuring a rails app by interpolating
values into template files and uploading them to servers.

# INSTALLATION

Using ansible-galaxy:

```sh
$ ansible-galaxy install rickapichairuk.deploy-rails-env-vars
```

Using `requirements.yml`:

```yaml
- src: rickapichairuk.deploy-rails-env-vars
  path: roles/
  name: rickapichairuk.deploy-rails-env-vars
```


# INTRODUCTION

In the spirit of [12 Factor Apps](https://12factor.net/) recommendation for
[configuring apps](https://12factor.net/config), this ansible role provides
mechanisms to manage the following commonly used rails configuration files.
You can use ansible-vault to encrypt configuration key/values.

# CONFIGURATION FILES SUPPORTED

* secrets.yml (rails [secrets.yml](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#custom-secrets) file)
* application.yml (used in conjunction with [Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro))
* database.yml (default [rails database configuration file](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database))
* newrelic.yml ([newrelic configuration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration) file)
* .rbenv-vars (used in conjunction with [rbenv-vars](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars))

# ONE FILE CONFIG

If you really want to use just one file to config your app, you can probably get
away with using .rbenv-vars and only deploy this one file. In order for this to 
work, you will have to setup rbenv on your server for the user that puma (and
sidekiq) run as. You will have to have to also write all your configuration
files (application.yml, database.yml, etc) to refer to ENV.

The main benefit of doing it this way is that you only have to deploy one file
and you can check in all the other configuration files (assuming they refer to
the ENV variables) into the repository.

# USING WITH CAPISTRANO AND SYMLINKED CONFIG FILES

You can deploy config files that have the configuration values interpolated into
configuration files.

Be sure to setup capistrano to use `:linked_files` and `:linked_dirs` to symlink
the files deployed by ansible and this role to the rails app deploy directory.

# WHY IS .rbenv-vars TREATED DIFFERENTLY?

The reason that .rbenv-vars can be configured to be symlinked is because the
author usually has the destination be the shared directory so it is in the same
directory as all the other configuration files. However, capistrano cannot
symlink the .rben-vars to the $HOME directory because it's not in the app
directory. Ansible is used to create the symlink from the shared directory to
the home directory.

For example:

```sh
$ ln -s /home/deploy_user/apps/your_app/shared/dot.rbenv-vars /home/deploy_user/.rbenv-var
```
